# Horse Action Recognition Dataset

This repository contains the link to the **Horse Action Recognition Dataset**, which is a dataset focused on horse movements. The dataset is labeled with three categories: `walk`, `trot`, and `canter`. It is designed for use in machine learning models for action recognition.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset includes video sequences of horses performing three different actions:

- **Walk**: A four-beat gait where the horse moves forward one leg at a time.
- **Trot**: A two-beat gait where diagonal pairs of legs move simultaneously.
- **Canter**: A three-beat gait where the horse moves in a specific sequence of legs.

Each folder within the dataset is named according to the action label and contains the corresponding image sequences.
